            <p>In the summer of 2023, our offline GRE courses at Weichen taught us to use Excel for word memorization by
                marking and sorting.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daisy-yanx/" target="_blank">Daisy Yan</a> and I found Excel
                particularly inconvenient as it wasn't accessible on mobile devices for on-the-go review. This website
                was thus created to be shared with everyone, aiming to assist every student preparing for the GRE and to
                maximize its value.</p>

                Carrying the 3000-word book around is very inconvenient. Current market apps for word memorization don’t
                provide the commonly used meanings of vocabulary in the GRE, like the 3000-word book does.
            </p>
            <p>Below are two effective methods for utilizing this word list:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Memorizing Words:
                        Memorize in random order and mark the words you don’t know. Over time, you will have encountered
                        and
                        appropriately marked all the words. Then, use the marked order to memorize the words you got
                        wrong,
                        starting from the top. This method is quite efficient.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Reviewing Words Before the Exam:
                        In random mode, delete the words you are familiar with. Typically, only a few hundred words
                        remain towards the end. Just review these words repeatedly in the days leading up to the exam.
                        Repeated review is highly effective for memorization.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The original list contains 3,072 words, all sourced from an Excel file provided by Teacher Qu Suowen.
                Tip: If you delete your entire word list, the next time you access this page, the complete list of words will be re-entered for you.
            </p>
            <p>It seems that viewing the word list on Android phones is a bit slow? It's very smooth on browsers with the Safari engine. This issue hasn't been resolved yet, and I hope everyone hasn't encountered it.</p>
